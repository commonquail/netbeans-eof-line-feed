        <h2>About EOF Line Feed</h2>
        <p>The <em>EOF Line Feed</em> plugin appends a line feed character (\n)
            to the end of every document when saved, unless the document is
            already terminated by a line feed.</p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>A number of tools expect text files to end with a line feed
            character. NetBeans allows the cursor to occupy and modify,
            including delete, the last line in a text file, and will then not
            ensure that the file is terminated by a line feed.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>The goal of this plugin is to ensure that all text files are
            terminated by a line feed. It is not to provide the ability to
            specify rules or otherwise adjust this behaviour. If you regularly
            edit files that should <em>not</em> be terminated by a line feed you
            probably should not be using this plugin.
